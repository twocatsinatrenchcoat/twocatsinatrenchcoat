Hi, I'm Trench!
I'm a CS student and bassist from the Netherlands with... probably too much time on my hands.


I don't use GitHub much, as most of the programming I work on is for little web toys that frequently get damned to development hell.

However, I'm looking to change this, and maybe collaborate on some stuff with people!
